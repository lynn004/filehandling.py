# My First Python File Handling Project üêç  

This is one of my first projects in Python where I‚Äôm learning about **file handling** and **exception handling**.  

The program is very simple but it taught me a lot:  
- How to open and read a file.  
- How to write a new file with some changes.  
- How to ask the user for a filename and handle errors if the file doesn‚Äôt exist.  

It may not be perfect, but it‚Äôs a big step for me in learning how Python works with files.  

## Files in this repo  
- `input.py` ‚Üí my Python code.  
- `README.md` ‚Üí this description.  

## How to run it  
1. Make sure Python is installed on your computer.  
2. Open a terminal in this folder.  
3. Run the file using:  
   ```bash
   python input.py
